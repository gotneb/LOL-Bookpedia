## ðŸ“– About
I made this project while following a course. I could learn a lot from it, including essential concepts, 
such as:
- Hilt/Dagger (Dependency Injection)
- Coil (Image loading)
- Ktor (HTTP requests)

## ðŸ¤— Acknowledgement
Thanks to [Daniel](https://github.com/daniatitienei) who taught how to create this app in his course about Jetpack Compose.

It has really helped me to learn a lot.
